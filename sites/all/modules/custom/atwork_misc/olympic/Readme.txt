OLYMPIC MEDAL OUTPUT
This directory holds one file (olympic.csv), which is parsed by atwork misc in order to dynamically update Canada's medal status for the 2016 Rio olympics.

The file is generated by crontab, which runs the php_medal_parser.php script (also in this file, but was originally run from my /home directory), which relies on the simple_html_dom.php script. It scrapes the medal numbers off of the official olympic website.
