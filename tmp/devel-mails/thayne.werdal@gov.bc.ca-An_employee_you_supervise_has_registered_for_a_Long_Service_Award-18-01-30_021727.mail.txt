THIS IS AN AUTOMATED EMAIL. NO RESPONSE IS REQUIRED.
This email is to advise you that Brendan Jennings, who you supervise, has
registered to receive a milestone 25year Long Service Award in 2018.

Eligible employees are any full-time, part-time or seasonal employees who
will reach their 25th, 30th, 35th, 40th, 45th or 50th anniversary with the BC
Public Service by December 31, 2018, or who have achieved one of these
milestones before this year but have not previously been recognized.

The 2018 Long Service Award ceremonies will be held at Government House in
Victoria this fall.  Invitations will be emailed to recipients in June, and
the dates of the ceremonies will be posted on @Work at that time.

Long Service Awards recipients from outside Greater Victoria are to be
approved time off to attend their ceremony. Travel costs, including
transportation, hotel and meal expenses for the recipient and one guest, will
be covered by the employeeâ€™s ministry or organization.

For Victoria-based recipients, taxi expenses to and from their ceremony are
to be covered by their ministry or organization. In addition, Victoria-based
recipients must be provided a reasonable amount of time to prepare for their
ceremony; therefore, it is recommended that recipients leave their workplace
by 2 p.m. on the day of their event without any negative impact to their pay.
In cases where the recipient is a front-line worker, arrangements for
coverage should be made in advance.

For more information about the Long Service Awards, including details about
travel reimbursement and time off for recipients, visit @Work [1]. If you
have additional questions, contact your workplace Long Service Award Contact
