-----------------------


THIS IS AN AUTOMATED EMAIL. NO RESPONSE IS REQUIRED.
You have successfully registered for a Long Service Award.

The 2018 ceremonies will be held at Government House in Victoria this fall
between September and November.

An electronic invitation to your Long Service Award ceremony will be emailed
to you in June. The date for your ceremony will be specified on your
invitation. Please note, because the ceremonies are tailored to host specific
ministries and organizations, it will not be possible to change your ceremony
date.

If you have registered but find that youâ€™re unable to attend your ceremony
this fall, you have a one-year grace period to attend the ceremony next year.
In this case, please RSVP your regrets and re-register for the Long Service
Awards in 2019. Arrangements will be made to have your award presented to you
at your workplace in 2018.

An email has been sent to your supervisor so that he/she is aware of your
registration for a Long Service Award and can provide you with the necessary
supports to attend your ceremony. For information about travel reimbursement
and taking time off, visit @Work [1] or contact your workplace Long Service
Award Contact. [2]

Note: You are responsible for booking your own travel to the ceremony. Please
connect with your workplace Long Service Award Contact [3] to confirm if your
organization has an internal travel process to follow and/or if someone will
be coordinating specific hotel arrangements for you.
