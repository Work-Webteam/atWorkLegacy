-------- TEST 
----------------------------------------------------------------

.... INNOVATION

The Innovation award recognizes groups, teams, or organizations within the BC
Public Service that have developed and transformed new ideas into tangible
initiatives, programs, or projects. By applying a user-centric or
citizen-centric approach, innovations may streamline business processes,
leverage technology, or pursue creative solutions to fulfill organizational
mandates. This award is recognized both regionally and provincially.
Approaches to innovation in the workplace may include:
  * Generating breakthrough ideas, fresh perspectives and new opportunities;
  * The use of new technology or tools to enhance program and service delivery
    or improve upon existing processes and procedures (i.e. Behavioural
    Insights, Data Science, Service Design,  Agile Methodology, etc.);
  * Improving performance by doing things that may be unique, leading-edge, or
    new to the public sector;
  * Changes to the organizational culture or the traditional approach to
    management or problem solving;
  * Ability to demonstrate an experimental or innovative mindset whereby being
    open to change, taking calculated risks and challenge the status quo to
    try something new, resulted in a measureable outcome;
  * Adapting and refining the approach or initiative when things have not
    worked well and learning from the setbacks/mistakes.
